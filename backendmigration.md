# Backend Migration Plan - Supabase Implementation

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Architecture

- **Project-Service Relationship**: Limited to service selection from predefined list

### Current Limitations
- No persistent database for finished project gallery
- Basic project-service relationship for filtering
- Single admin user for project gallery management
- Google Drive photo storage not fully integrated
- No advanced filtering for public gallery visitors
- Manual JSON file management for project data
